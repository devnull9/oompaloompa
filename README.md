## Intro
This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) starter kit. It sets up the development environment enabling the latest JavaScript features and uses build tools like Babel and webpack under the hood, but works with zero configuration.


## Getting started

1. Clone or download the project
2. Enter the project directory
3. Install the node_modules
4. Start the project
````
cd oompaloompa
npm install
npm start
````


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
On Linux or Mac OS there is a max number of system<br>
watchers that eventually need to be increased for larger<br>
projects if Jest is trying to watch too many files. Fix here:
````
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```` 


#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.
